### Terms
* A producer is a user application that sends messages.
* A queue is a buffer that stores messages.
* A consumer is a user application that receives messages.
* Message broker: it accepts and forwards messages.
* Exchange: the producer can only send messages to an exchange. An exchange is a very simple thing. On one side it receives messages from producers and the other side it pushes them to queues. (direct, topic, headers and fanout)
