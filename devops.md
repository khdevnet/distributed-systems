# DevOps

* We need to have single terraform script which create DEV/QA/UAT/PROD, not copy paste resources to different scripts
* If Story required Infrastructure updates, PR should be created and attached to the Story
* PR should be reviewed by TechLead
* Deploy of infrastructure should be done using pipline (Configuration Drift)
* It can be several pipelines but they should deploy automatically to eliminate missed configurations
